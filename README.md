# Alex's emacs.d

Uses `cask` and `pallet` to manage packages for my personal emacs setup so it can be shared across machines easily.

## Usage

Make sure you have `cask` installed. See https://github.com/cask/cask for details.

```
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:alexkehayias/emacs.d.git
cd ~/.emacs.d
cask install
emacs
```
